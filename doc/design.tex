\chapter{Design}\label{chap:design}
The design of the Muen\index{Muen} kernel is inspired by the Common Criteria
separation kernel protection profile (SKPP\index{SKPP}) \cite{SKPP}, which has
been used in the certification of Green Hills' INTEGRITY-178B kernel. The
protection profile has been retired by the National Information Assurance
Partnership (NIAP) in 2011.  Nevertheless we believe the document can be used
as a sound basis and provide guidance to derive requirements for a separation
kernel appropriate for systems requiring high robustness.

The separation kernel should allow the construction of systems that could be
exposed to attackers with high potential and deployed in the most difficult
threat environments.

The first part of the chapter presents what is considered out of scope in the
context of this project. It is followed by the requirements that are at the core
of the kernel design. After that the subject concept is introduced, which is in
turn needed for the presentation of the overall system architecture and the
design of the Muen kernel in section \ref{sec:architecture}.
