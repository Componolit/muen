\chapter{Design}
The design of the Muen kernel is inspired by the Common Criteria separation
kernel protection profile (SKPP) \cite{SKPP}, which has been used in the
certification of Green Hills' INTEGRITY-178B kernel (see section
\ref{subsec:commercial-sks}). The protection profile has been sunset by the
National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) in 2011. Nevertheless we
believe the document can be used as a sound basis and provide guidance to
derive requirements for a separation kernel appropriate for systems requiring
high robustness.

The separation kernel should allow the construction of systems, that could be
exposed to attackers with high attack potential and deployed in the most
difficult threat environment.

TODO: Provide overview of the chapter structure.
