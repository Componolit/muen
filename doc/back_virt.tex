\section{Virtualization}
Virtualization is an established architectural concept in computer science and
has been in use for decades. Operating systems for example provide virtual
address spaces to application processes, giving them the illusion of unlimited,
continuous memory. An application does not need to take care of complex memory
management tasks and the operating system is able to optimize the usage of
physical memory. Another common example is the virtualization of devices such
as virtual CD-ROM drives directly using a file-based backend for data I/O
\cite{CryptoCloud}.

Hardware or platform virtualization is the process of creating virtual computer
hardware that acts like real hardware. The virtualization is performed and
controlled by special software, called a \emph{hypervisor}\index{hypervisor} or
\emph{virtual machine monitor} (VMM\index{VMM}). These two terms are synonyms,
for consistency we will use VMM throughout this document. VMMs are classified
into two types, see figure \ref{fig:vmm-classification}.

\end{figure}

The VMM runs on the \emph{host} and software that runs in a virtualized
environment is called \emph{guest} software. The words host and guest are
generally used to distinguish the software that runs on the physical machine
from the software that runs on the virtual machine (VM\index{VM})
\cite{wiki:virtualization}.

By using virtualization and scheduling techniques, a VMM multiplexes the
hardware of a computer making it possible to run multiple guests
simultaneously\footnote{On multicore machines in parallel, on single-core
machines in pseudo-parallel} on a single physical machine. This is the most
common use-case for virtualization: the consolidation of operating system
instances on one server to save power and to improve hardware-resource
utilization.

A guest program is separated from the real hardware of a machine. Direct access
is restricted and can be controlled by the host VMM. Since the VMM has complete
control over the hardware and guest software state, virtualization is also
useful for separation purposes. The VMM is able allow certain communication
channels between guest software while restricting others. One guest could have
access to the network card, while others share a page in memory but have no
access to hardware devices.

The principle idea of virtualization is to run guest code on a (virtual) CPU and
only intercept privileged operations accessing resources or system properties
for which direct access is prohibited or a different representation must be
provided. Various techniques exist to intercept guest instructions, ranging from
the inspection and modification of the guest software instruction stream (slow)
to hardware-assisted virtualization (fast). This thesis focuses on the
hardware-assisted approach, the reader is directed to
\cite{VMware:virtualization} for further information about virtualization
mechanisms.

Independent of the chosen mechanism, an interception of the running guest leads
to a so called \emph{trap}\index{trap} from the guest code into the VMM. The VMM
then reacts by examining the \emph{exit reason} and acts accordingly by e.g.
modifying the guest software state and then resuming the guest.

This method is also used to implement a technique called "trap and emulate". For
example if a guest accesses a device which is emulated by the VMM, access to the
virtual device causes a trap into the VMM. The VMM itself or a special monitor
VM then emulates the requested operations of the guest software by directly
modifying the state of the virtual processor or memory of the guest VM.

With hardware-assisted virtualization, traps are caused by the virtualization
hardware automatically. The exact behavior is configurable by the VMM software.

\subsection{Intel Virtualization Technology (VT)}
A trap from the guest into the VMM is a costly operation. To reduce traps,
mechanisms in modern processors have been introduced to support the VMM in
creating a virtual machine environment. These features not only improve the
performance of a virtual machine by avoiding traps, but also greatly simplify
the VMM implementation.

Intel Virtualization Technology (VT\index{VT}) provides hardware-assisted
virtualization mechanisms for Intel processors. Intel VT encompasses multiple
virtualization features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Intel VT-x
	\item Intel EPT
	\item Intel VT-d
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Intel VT-x}
Intel VT-x\index{VT-x} provides a virtual machine architecture to allow
efficient processor virtualization. An Intel processor reports this feature
with the Virtual Machine Extensions (VMX\index{VMX}) CPU flag.

The virtual machine architecture is implemented by a new form of processor
operation called VMX operation. This mode is enabled by executing the
\texttt{VMXON} instruction and, if successful, provides two operating modes:
VMX root operation and VMX non-root operation.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\input{graph_vmm_lifecycle}
	\caption{Interaction of VMM and Guests}
	\label{fig:vmm-lifecycle}
\end{figure}

The VMX root operation mode is used by the VMM software while guest software
runs in VMX non-root operation mode. A transition from VMX root to VMX non-root
is called a VM entry, while a transition from VMX non-root to VMX root is called
a VM exit or trap. Figure \ref{fig:vmm-lifecycle} shows the life cycle of a VMM
and the transitions between guest software and the VMM.

Processor behavior in VMX root mode is very similar to non-VMX operation.  The
main difference is the extra instruction set provided by VMX, containing
virtualization-specific instructions used to manage VMX processor mode and
virtual machine control structures.

In VMX non-root operation however, the execution environment is restricted to
facilitate virtualization. Privileged or critical instructions cause VM exits
instead of their normal behavior. This allows the VMM to regain control of
processor resources if needed and, depending on the trapping instruction, take
appropriate action such as emulating certain functionality.

The VMM software initiates a VM entry into guest code by executing the
\texttt{VMLAUNCH} and \texttt{VMRESUME} instructions. Only one guest can be
active on a logical processor at any given time. The VMM regains control using
the VM exit mechanism. If an exit occurs, the VMM analyzes the cause for the
exit and acts accordingly. It may resume the guest software or allocate
processor time to another guest. The VMM exits VMX operation by calling the
\texttt{VMXOFF} instruction.

The Virtual-Machine Control Structure (VMCS\index{VMCS}) is used to control VMX
non-root operation and VMX transitions. Each virtual machine has a VMCS
assigned which allows fine-grained setup of processor behavior in VMX non-root
mode. A VMCS contains fields which can be written by the
\texttt{VMWRITE}\index{VMWRITE} instruction and read via
\texttt{VMREAD}\index{VMREAD} in VMX root mode. The fields can be divided into
host-state, guest-state, read-only data and control fields. On VM entry for
example, the state of the host is saved into the subject VMCS and restored
again on VM exit. The control fields in the VMCS govern VMX non-root operation.

For further information about the VMX processor extensions and VMCS, the reader
is directed to the respective chapter in the Intel Software Developer
Manual\index{Intel SDM} \cite{IntelSDM}, volume 3C, chapter 23.

\subsubsection{Intel EPT}\label{subsubsec:ept}
Extended Page Table (EPT\index{EPT}) is Intel's implementation of the Second
Level Address Translation (SLAT\index{SLAT}) virtualization technology. It
provides hardware-assisted translation of guest-physical memory addresses to
host physical addresses. Guest-physical addresses are translated by traversing a
set of EPT paging structures provided by the VMM to produce physical addresses
that are used to access memory \cite{IntelSDM}.

The EPT paging structure confines the host physical memory region a guest
virtual machine is allowed to access, making it possible to safely run
unmodified guest OS memory management code. Access to host physical memory
outside of the allowed region will result in an EPT violation which causes trap.

Without EPT, the burden of translating guest-physical addresses to host physical
addresses while guaranteeing guest/vmm and guest/guest memory space separation
lies with the VMM. This is a non-trivial task which is highly inefficient. EPT
removes the complexity of manual memory address translations from the VMM,
making the code simpler while improving virtualization speed. For more
information about EPT see Intel SDM \cite{IntelSDM}, volume 3C, section 28.2.

\subsubsection{Intel VT-d}\label{subsubsec:vtd}
Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d\index{VT-d}) provides hardware
support for I/O-device virtualization. While VT-x provides the support to
virtualize the platform (i.e. the processor), VT-d is used to simplify the
direct assignment of devices to virtual machines by providing direct memory
access (DMA\index{DMA}) and device interrupt remapping functionality. VT-d
provides an IOMMU\index{IOMMU} required to control device DMA (see also section
\ref{subsec:ich}).

The VT-d technology is outside the scope of this master thesis, the reader is
directed to \cite{IntelVTd} for a more in-depth discussion.
