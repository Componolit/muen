\section{Subject}\label{sec:design-subject}
A subject is a software component executed by the separation kernel. Similar
terms used in literature are partition, container, task or component. Subjects
constitute the majority of a system based on the Muen kernel. They are intended
to be used as the building blocks of a component-based security system.

The main purpose of the kernel is to execute an arbitrary number of subjects,
giving them access to assigned resources and only allowing communication between
subjects via explicitly defined channels. The kernel manages subject execution
and treats all subjects equally.

Information related to a subject is divided into two distinct categories:

\begin{description}
	\item[Specification] encompasses all static configuration data, that is
		constant and does not change during the runtime of the system, e.g.
		assigned hardware devices and memory resources.
	\item[State] is made up of all transient values that are potentially
		modified by the execution of a subject, e.g. CPU register values.
\end{description}

\subsection{Subject Specification}
The specification defines the resources that a subject is allowed to access,
what execution environment the kernel must provide for the subject, the initial
state and of course the subject binary itself. All resources that a subject can
access, must be explicitly defined in the specification, which includes the
complete memory layout of the subject.

This information is part of the overall system specification and is fixed at
integration time. It does not change during the execution of the system. The
kernel keeps this information as part of the compiled system policy in read-only
memory. Since subjects are unable to access kernel memory, the subject
specifications cannot be tampered with.

\subsection{Subject State}
Running a subject inevitable affects and changes the execution environment. The
state of a subject encompasses all system elements that are visible to the
subject. In particular this includes the CPU registers, instruction and stack
pointer as well as control register values.

Since the kernel suspends and resumes subject execution and potentially
multiple subjects can be executed in arbitrary order, the state of the system
as viewed by the subject must be saved. The state must be restored accurately
upon resumption, otherwise the subject will not be able to execute seamlessly.

Subject management information used by the kernel during runtime is also
considered part of the subject state. This includes a data structure for
storing pending interrupts to be delivered to the subject.

\subsection{Subject Profile}
Two types of subjects are distinguished:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Native applications
	\item Virtual Machine (VM\index{VM}) subjects
\end{itemize}

Each of these types is captured by so called \emph{subject
profiles}\index{subject profiles}. These profiles determine the execution
environment and architectural features (e.g.  memory management) that the
subject is allowed to use. Profiles are declared in the subject specification.
The currently supported profiles are described in the following sections.

\subsubsection{Native Subject}
A \emph{native} subject is a 64-bit application, that executes directly on the
virtual processor without any supporting operating system kernel or runtime
environment. Such applications are also known as bare bones, bare metal or bare
machine.

The execution environment of the native subject profile has the following main
properties:

\begin{itemize}
	\item IA-32e/64-bit processor mode
	\item No mode switching
	\item No memory management (static paging structures)
	\item No hardware exception handling
	\item No control register access
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{VM Subject}
A \emph{virtual machine} (VM) subject has more control over its execution
environment. The VM profile is intended for executing operating systems such as
Linux.

The execution environment of the VM subject profile has the following main
properties:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Switching between 32-bit and 64-bit modes
	\item Memory management and page table management via EPT
	\item Hardware exception handling
	\item Restricted control register access
\end{itemize}
