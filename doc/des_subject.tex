\section{Subject concept}
A subject is an untrusted software component that is executed by the separation
kernel. Similar terms used in literature are partition or component. Besides the
separation kernel itself, subjects constitute the majority of a system based on
the Muen kernel.

The main purpose of the kernel is to execute an arbitrary number of subjects,
giving them access to assigned resources and only allowing communication between
subjects via explicitly defined channels. The kernel treats all subjects equally.

We categorize the information related to a subject into two distinct categories:

\begin{description}
	\item[Specification] encompasses all static configuration data, that is
		constant and does not change during the runtime of the system, e.g.
		assigned hardware devices.
	\item[State] is made up of all transient values that are potentially modified
		by the execution of a subject, e.g. CPU register values.
\end{description}

\subsection{Subject specification}
The specification defines, what resources a subject is allowed to access, what
environment the kernel must provide for the subject, the initial state of the
execution environment and of course the subject binary itself.

This information is part of the overall system specification and is fixed at
integration time. It does not change during the execution of the system. The
kernel keeps this information as part of the compiled system policy in read-only
memory. Since subjects are unable to access kernel memory, the subject
specifications cannot be tampered with and change.

\subsection{Subject state}
Running a subject changes the execution environment. The state of a subject
encompasses all system elements that are visible to the subject and can contain
different information depending on the current subject. In particular this
encompasses the CPU registers, instruction and stack pointer as well as control
register values.

Since the kernel can pause and resume subject execution and potentially multiple
subjects can be executed in arbitrary order the state of the system as viewed by
the subject must be saved. The state must be restored accurately upon resumption
otherwise the subject will not be able to execute seamlessly. Additionally, if a
subject is not oblivious to the fact that the kernel is saving and loading its
state, the isolation of the subject would be insufficient since this would be an
unintended information flow.

\subsection{Subject profile}
Two types of subjects are distinguished:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Native applications
	\item Virtual Machine (VM) subjects
\end{itemize}

Each of these types is captured by so called subject profiles. These profiles
determine the execution environment and architectural features (e.g. memory
management) the subject is allowed to use. The profiles are described in the
following sections.

\subsubsection{Native subject}
A \emph{native} subject is an 64-bit application, that executes directly on the
processor without any supporting operating system kernel or runtime environment.
Such applications may also be called bare bones or bare metal.

The execution environment of the native subject profile has the following main
properties:

\begin{itemize}
	\item IA-32e/64-bit processor mode
	\item No mode switching
	\item No memory management/static paging structures
	\item No exception handling
	\item No control register access
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{VM subject}
A \emph{virtual machine} (VM) subject has more control over its execution
environment and the VM profile is intended for running whole operating systems
such as xv6 or Linux.

The execution environment of the VM subject profile has the following main
properties:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Switching between 32-bit and 64-bit modes
	\item Memory management and page table management
	\item Exception handling via IDT
	\item Restricted control register access
\end{itemize}
