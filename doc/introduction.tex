\chapter{Introduction}
As computer systems are entrusted with more and more sensitive and personal
information, the need to effectively control who has access to the data becomes
increasingly important. Recent revelations about very sophisticated and targeted
attacks as well as broad, nation-wide surveillance programs seriously call the
effectiveness of currently deployed security systems in question.

A common defense strategy is to compartmentalize information and its processing.
An example would be the usage of a dedicated computer for internet banking, that
is only connected to the internet when needed. It is obvious that this approach
does not scale well, since this would necessitate having a separate device for
each task that should be performed in some form of isolation.

A separation kernel (SK) is a specialized security kernel which provides an
execution environment for multiple components that can only communicate ac-
cording to a given policy and are otherwise isolated from each other. Hereby
the isolation also includes the limitation of potential side- and covert channels.
It can serve as a basis for the implementation of a component-based system.
Unfortunately to our knowledge, no freely available SK exists to this date.

Related problems can arise in cloud services, where multiple unaffiliated parties
share the same physical machine but must be separated from each other to not
(involuntarily) share any data. Recent attacks
\cite{Wu:2012:WHH:2362793.2362802} have demonstrated that current solutions do
not provide the necessary degree of isolation. Since the adoption of
virtualization, especially in the field of cloud computing, has rapidly
increased in the past years, chip manufacturers such as Intel are extending
their processors with advanced hardware virtualization features.

Another issue is the complexity associated with developing security systems that
must exhibit very strong robustness and provide high assurance. Tools and
methods such as formal verification exist but are rarely used. A small code base
results in better verifiability since the complexity of the software should be
manageable and the effort needed for review is greatly reduced.

SPARK, which is a programming language, is used for the development of industrial
high integrity projects. It provides means to proof certain properties of the
code and its track record \cite{Chapman:2000:IES:369264.369270} shows, that it
can be used to effectively implement real-world systems.

All these recent developments provide a good setting for the design and
implementation of an open-source separation kernel. Using hardware
virtualization features for component separation and leveraging Intel's latest
processor features should allow to implement a minimal kernel suitable for
formal verification. Using SPARK as the programming language greatly increases
the confidence in the implementation since it allows to completely eliminate
complete categories of common programming errors, e.g. buffer overflows.

This document presents the design and implementation of the Muen separation
kernel, which was developed during the course of our master thesis.

\section{Notation}
This section presents the notational conventions used throughout this document.

\paragraph{Keywords}
Important terms and concepts that are introduced for the first time are
presented in \emph{italic style}. Subsequent occurrences of the same term have
no special formatting. The same style is also used to \emph{emphasize} words in
the text.

\paragraph{Numbers}
Regular numbers that have no leading special character are expressed as decimal
values. Hexadecimal numbers such as memory addresses are explicitly preceded by
\texttt{0x}.

\paragraph{Units}
Storage units such as kilo-, mega- and gigabyte are designated by
the common abbreviations KB, MB and GB.

\paragraph{Tools and Procedures}
References to subroutines and keywords of a programming language, as well as
command line tools are formatted in \texttt{typewriter} style.

\section{Related literature}
Since the target hardware platform of the separation kernel is the Intel x86
architecture, its specification called "Intel\textsuperscript{\textregistered}
64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual"
\cite{IntelSDM}\index{Intel SDM} is the main source of technical information
concerning the hardware platform. The documents are commonly referred to by
their short name \emph{Intel SDM}.

The books are available online and updated by Intel on a regular basis. This
can lead to changes in the document structure. The chapter and section
citations given in this report refer to the Intel SDM revision 44, released in
August 2012.

\section{Provenance of project name}
\emph{Muen} is Japanese and translates to "unrelated/without relation". It was
chosen since it is a fitting allegory of the components isolated by the
separation kernel. Figure \ref{fig:muen} depicts the word in Japanese kanji
characters.

The root of the word Muen is "Mu" which denotes a negative: the absence of
everything. It is a keyword in Chan and Zen Buddhism and also mentioned in the
Jargon File \cite{jargonfile}.
