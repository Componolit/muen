\section{Example system}\label{sec:example-system}
The Muen project contains an example system that makes use of all the
mechanisms described in the previous sections. Figure \ref{fig:example-system}
shows a schematic overview of the system.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\input{graph_arch_example}
	\caption{Example system}
	\label{fig:example-system}
\end{figure}

The system is composed of the Muen kernel and four subjects, three of which are
trusted and one xv6 subject is untrusted. The trusted subjects run in the native
profile and are implemented in Ada/SPARK, the untrusted xv6 subject runs a teaching
OS written in C inside the VM profile.

The example system is meant to serve as demonstrator for a real-world use-case:
An untrusted operating system is separated by the Muen kernel and accesses
native, trusted services with minimal TCB. The trusted services might even be
formally verified.

The following section explains the different subjects composing the example
system, while section \ref{subsec:keyboard-handling} describes the keyboard
handling in detail to illustrate how the different mechanisms are tied
together.

\subsection{Subjects}

\subsubsection{VT}\label{subsubsec:subject-vt}
The VT subject manages virtual terminal consoles and owns the keyboard. The
system policy therefore assigns the hardware devices shown by listing
\ref{lst:hardware-devs} to the subject. This allows the VT subject to control
the VGA cursor and the contents of the VGA memory. The kernel also programs the
system's I/O APIC so that only the VT subject receives keyboard interrupts (IRQ
1).

\begin{lstlisting}[
	language=xml,
	label=lst:hardware-devs,
	caption=Subject device assignment]
<device name="keyboard" irq="1">
    <io_port start="0060" end="0060"/>
    <io_port start="0064" end="0064"/>
</device>

<device name="vga">
    <memory_layout>
        <memory_region physical_address="b8000" virtual_address="b8000" ...
    </memory_layout>
</device>

<device name="cursor">
    <io_port start="03d4" end="03d5"/>
</device>
\end{lstlisting}

The other subjects of the example system have no direct access to the real VGA
memory but write to a distinct page mapped to their (virtual) VGA memory
address (\emph{0xb8000}). The subject virtual terminal pages are also mapped
into the address space of the VT subject.

If the user hits the special keys F1 to F6, the VT subjects updates the VGA
memory with the contents of the active session slot's virtual terminal page.
All other keyboard scancodes are copied to a driver page shared with the
untrusted xv6 subject and an event is sent to inform it that keyboard data
awaits processing by its virtual keyboard driver.

\subsubsection{Crypter}
The crypter subject uses the libsparkcrypto \cite{libsparkcrypto} library to
provide trusted cryptographic services to clients. On startup, the subject
enters the halted state until it receives an interrupt event indicating a
pending request.

The interrupt event resumes the subject and data contained in the subject's
request page is copied for further processing. Currently, the crypter subject
creates a SHA-256 REF message digest over the received data and then copies the
hash to the service response page. An interrupt event is triggered to signal
service completion.

\subsubsection{xv6}\label{subsubsec:xv6}
Xv6\index{xv6} is a Version 6 Unix \cite{wiki:unix6} teaching operating system
developed at MIT \cite{xv6}. While being simple, it implements many key
concepts found in common operating systems, making it an ideal initial target
for the VM profile. Xv6 is written in ANSI C.

Minimal changes in the source code of xv6 were required to run it as VM subject
on the Muen kernel:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Disable MP support
	\item Ignore disallowed I/O operations (handled by the SM subject)
\end{itemize}

Since the xv6 subject has no direct access to the keyboard, a simple virtual
keyboard driver has been implemented.

\subsubsection{Subject Monitor}
The subject monitor (SM\index{SM}) subject is used to monitor the untrusted xv6
subject. It displays information about I/O operations and has complete access to
the architectural state of the xv6 subject. Currently, no emulation is needed to
run xv6. If an unexpected trap occurs, a state dump is output and the virtual
CPU (VCPU\index{VCPU}) is halted.

\subsection{Keyboard handling}\label{subsec:keyboard-handling}
This section describes how the keyboard is handled in the example system using
the mechanisms provided by the Muen kernel.

When pressing a key on the keyboard, the keyboard controller raises an interrupt
request (IRQ\index{IRQ}) with number 1 to signal new data. The system policy
applied by the Muen kernel on startup enforces that this interrupt is routed to
the appropriate processor running the VT subject. This is done using the IRQ
routing specification generated during policy compilation and depends on the
assignment of hardware devices to subjects. In this case, the keyboard is
assigned to subject 1, which is the VT subject described in section
\ref{subsubsec:subject-vt}. Listing \ref{lst:ex-irq-routing} shows the IRQ
routing table of the example system.

\begin{lstlisting}[
	language=Ada,
	label=lst:ex-irq-routing,
	caption=Example system IRQ routing table]
IRQ_Routing : constant IRQ_Routing_Array := IRQ_Routing_Array'(
  1 => IRQ_Route_Type'(
    CPU    => 0,
    IRQ    => 1,
    Vector => 33));
\end{lstlisting}

The routing table contains one entry which routes the keyboard IRQ 1 to the CPU
with APIC ID 0. Furthermore, the IRQ is remapped to the interrupt vector 33 so
that on each key press, CPU0 will be interrupted with an interrupt vector 33.

The Muen kernel running on CPU0 handles the received interrupt in its
\texttt{Handle\_Irq} procedure. It uses the vector routing table contained in
the SPARK-compliant interrupt specification compiled by the \texttt{skpolicy}
tool, see listing \ref{lst:ex-vector-routing}. The table instructs the kernel to
inject interrupt vector 33 into the subject with ID 1 by using the interrupt
injection mechanism described in section \ref{subsec:int-injection}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
	language=Ada,
	label=lst:ex-vector-routing,
	caption=Example system CPU0 vector routing table]
Vector_Routing : constant Vector_Routing_Array := Vector_Routing_Array'(
  33     => 1,
  others => Skp.Invalid_Subject);
\end{lstlisting}

The VT subject receives interrupt vector 33 in its interrupt handling routine
and, because it is allowed to access the respective I/O ports, reads in the
keyboard scancodes. If the received scancode is not related to the special keys
F1 to F6 and the currently visible subject is xv6, the scancode data is copied
into a memory page shared with the xv6 subject. The VT subject then triggers an
event to inform the xv6 subject about new data to process. This is done using
the Muen hypercall mechanism.

The kernel running the VT subject forwards the interrupt event to the respective
subject as defined by the policy. In this case, it is the xv6 subject.

The xv6 subject's interrupt handler code runs unmodified and detects that a
keyboard interrupt has occurred. The appropriate keyboard handling code is
called, which has been slightly modified to read keyboard scancodes from a
shared memory page instead of doing port I/O. The copied scancode data is then
used to drive the terminal console.
