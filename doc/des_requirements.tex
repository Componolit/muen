\section{Requirements}\label{sec:requirements}

The following properties specify the requirements of the separation kernel and
the system's TCB:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The kernel implementation must be minimal and robust to allow thorough
		review and verification.
	\item System resources internal to the kernel, that are not exported to
		subjects, must not be accessible.
	\item The kernel must provide mechanisms to enforce a given policy and not
		perform autonomous policy decisions.
	\item The kernel must support the Intel IA-32e/64-bit architecture and
		system memory larger than 4GB.
	\item The kernel must allow the implementation of small and simple
		components and not impose unnecessary restrictions that would increase
		subject complexity.
	\item A subject must be able to only access its assigned resources. Access
		to other resources must be prohibited. This includes devices and memory
		that has not been allocated to any subject.
	\item Assignment of subject resources must be static. A malicious subject
		must not be able to gain access to additional resources or consume all
		system resources.
	\item Isolated subjects must not be able to exchange any information.
	\item Information flows between subjects must only be present if explicitly
		specified in the system policy.
	\item It must be possible to specify directed information flows, where data
		can be transferred from source to destination but not in the reverse
		direction.
	\item 64-bit programs must be supported to run as subjects.
	\item Subjects must be able to use hardware devices and process device
		generated interrupts.
	\item A mechanism for inter-subject notifications must exist.
	\item The Muen kernel design, source code and documentation must be made
		freely available to allow independent verification and analysis.
\end{enumerate}
