\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}
Foremost, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to our advisor Prof.
Dr. Andreas Steffen for the continuous support in the course of our studies and
for the guidance in writing this master thesis. His help and generosity allowed
us to work in such an interesting field of research.

Many thanks also to our colleagues and friends at secunet Security Networks AG
in Germany, Alexander Senier, Robert Dorn and Stefan Berghofer for their
tremendous assistance not only during this thesis, but also during the many
projects we have realized together. We were able to learn a lot and without
their support and immense knowledge in the area of high-security platforms we
would not have been able to implement the Muen kernel in such short time.

We thank Prof. Dr. Endre Bangerter from the University of Applied Sciences in
Bern for being our expert and reviewer. Thanks also to Daniel Bigelow for
proofreading the report.

Last but not least, many thanks to our families and friends for their support
and understanding throughout the writing of this master thesis.
