\begin{abstract}
Microkernels are well suited as a basis for systems with high demands on
robustness. They are by definition small, which is a precondition for rigorous
verification of correctness. Additionally, they lend themselves to the
construction of component-based systems where the incorrect behavior of one
partition does not impact the whole system. In contrast, attaining high
assurance for today's monolithic operating systems is exceptionally hard since
they tend to be large and include complex functionality. This fact is
highlighted by regular security updates provided by operating system vendors.

A separation kernel (SK) is a specialized security kernel that provides an
execution environment for multiple components that can only communicate
according to a given policy and are otherwise isolated from each other. Hence,
the isolation also includes the limitation of potential side- and covert
channels. SKs are generally more static and smaller than microkernels, which
minimizes the possibility of kernel failure and should simplify the application
of formal verification techniques.

Even though the SK concept has garnered quite some attention from the research
community over the last thirty years, no freely available SK exists to this
day. A few commercial products exist, but little technical information is
publicly available.

Recent addition of advanced hardware virtualization support for the Intel x86
architecture has the potential of greatly simplifying the implementation of a
separation kernel. This thesis presents a design of a separation kernel for the
Intel x86 architecture using the latest Intel hardware features. An open-source
prototype written in SPARK demonstrates the viability of the envisioned
concept and the application of SPARK's proof capabilities increases the
assurance of the correctness of the implementation.

\section*{Acknowledgments}
Foremost, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to our advisor Prof.
Dr. Andreas Steffen for the continuous support in the course of our studies and
for the guidance in writing this master thesis. His help and generosity allowed
us to work in such an interesting field of research.

Many thanks also to our colleagues and friends at secunet Security Networks AG
in Germany, Alexander Senier, Robert Dorn and Stefan Berghofer for their
tremendous assistance not only during this thesis, but also during the many
projects we have realized together. We were able to learn a lot and without
their support and immense knowledge in the area of high-security platforms we
would not have been able to implement the Muen kernel in such short time.

We also thank Prof. Dr. Endre Bangerter from the University of Applied Sciences
in Bern for being our expert and reviewer.

Last but not least, many thanks to our families and friends for their support
and understanding throughout the writing of this master thesis.
